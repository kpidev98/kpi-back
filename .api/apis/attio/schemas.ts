This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, \"2023\", \"2023-01\", \"2023-01-02\", \"2023-01-02T13:00\", \"2023-01-02T13:00:00\", and \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000\" will all be coerced to \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z\". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string \"2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00\" will result in the value \"2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z\" being returned.
